A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/andytran/pen/PwoQgO.

 Flat Login Form version 3.0 has been recreated from the ground up as apart of my full blown UI Kit project.
Everything has been converted to Jade & SCSS.
A lot of properties have been removed, as well as unneeded prefixes.
